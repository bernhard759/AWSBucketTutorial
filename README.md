# S3 Data Reader/Writer

This Python project demonstrates how to read and write dummy data to an Amazon S3 bucket using the `boto3` library. It provides a simple example of interacting with AWS S3 storage from your Python application.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- AWS account with proper credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)
- An existing S3 bucket (or create a new one)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone 
cd 
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

Creating a virtual environment is a best practice for managing project dependencies in Python. It helps isolate the project's dependencies from other projects on your system.

```
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For Unix/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install project dependencies:**

After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install the `boto3` library and any other dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Configure AWS credentials:**

Before running the application, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this in one of the following ways:

- Set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
- Create an AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows) and add your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

5. **Run the application:**

Once you have configured your AWS credentials, you can run the application with the following command:

```
python readbucket.py
```

This will execute the `readbucket.py` script, which contains the code to read  dummy data to your S3 bucket.

## Project Structure

- `readbucket.py`: The script that contains the code to write to the S3 bucket.
- `writebucket.py`: The script that contains the code to read from the S3 bucket.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the project's dependencies (e.g., `boto3`).
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the project.
